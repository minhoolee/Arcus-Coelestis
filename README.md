# Arcus Coelestis
By Min Hoo Lee (March - May 2015)

## Project Description
The objective of this orb shooter game is to teach the
Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) colorscheme. 

The game presents a series of orbs at the top of the screen which possess 
different HSV color values. The player must control the color of their 
shooter's orb to approximate the color of one of the top orbs and then these 
two orbs must collide to earn points. Beware, there are limited lives!

Apologies for having all 1600+ lines of code in one file; I originally kept
this as a Github Gist for some reason, so it was in one file. Also,
I wrote this as a first-year programmer, so the quality is pretty bad.

Read the tutorial for more information on HSV and how to play.

## Motivation For Creation
I created this game for a "Game in 5 Weeks" final project in my school's
Java class. This project was, as aptly named, a game that we were to create
in 5 weeks with the catch that it had to have some educational value.
I picked the aim to teach HSV because I was very involved with computer vision
due to my [work in Robotics](https://github.com/valkyrierobotics/vision2017.git)
and inspiration from my Dad whose job is related to color balances in screens.

## Why "Arcus Coelestis"?
This name means "Rainbow" in Latin, and I pretty much picked it because it 
sounded unique and catchy. It also matches the theme of HSV colors but mostly
the first reason.
